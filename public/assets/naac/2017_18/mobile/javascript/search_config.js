They were appreciative of the efforts                        made at the teachers’ level as well as University level towards overall development of                        students.                      Most  parents  were  typically  appreciative  of  the  Mentor-Mentee  concept  put  in                        practice across the University to facilitate continuous mentoring of the students. They                        also expressed their satisfaction towards the student information system followed in                        the university.                      Some of the parents emphasized on establishment of formal collaborations with the                        foreign universities (USA, Canada and Australia) for student exchange programmes.                      While  most  parents  were  convinced  about  the  relevance  and  richness  of  the                        curriculum, a general concern was expressed regarding enhancing the curriculum to                        include  more  hands-on  experience  and  on-field  training/exposure  to  make  students                        industry-ready.                     Brief report on Feedback obtained from Employers                      In general, experts from recruiting industries in various domains have recognized the                        curricula across the University to have a great learning value.  In several segments,                        these  experts  have  extended  various  constructive  suggestions  over  the  technical                        content of the curricula.                      Industry employers are also extremely satisfied with the increasing efforts made at                        University level to strengthen the industry-academia association.                      Recruiters also emphasized on strengthening the soft skills and communication skills                        essential  for  personal  interview,  professional  relations  and  overall  improvement  of                        students’ employability.                      Several  recruiters  have  expressed  that  while  framing  a  technically  advanced                        curriculum is the need to cater the industrial needs, the teaching practices should be                        adopted  so  as  to  strengthen  the  fundamentals  of  the  students.  Although  the  use  of                        simulation  softwares  and  e-material  was  overall  appreciated  by  employers,  several                        industry stakeholders opined that overuse of these may hinder the process of building                        fundamental concepts.                      Some recruiters also suggested that the curriculum should try to cover an overview of                        certain  important  statutory  aspects  of  professional  practices  like  income  tax,  PF,                        labour laws, licensing, insurance, wages etc.                     Brief report on Feedback obtained from Students-Passing Out Batch                      Most students are satisfied with the teaching methodologies and spectrum of courses                        offered to them. Some segments of students however felt that the laboratory/practical                        component can be further increased.

They  were  satisfied  with  the                        understanding they gained from the courses transacted.

This  is  undertaken  at  two  levels  (i)  individual  course                        coordinator  and  (ii)  student  counselling  system.  For  every  course,  the  course                        coordinator  keeps  a  performance  record  of  students  and  discusses  the  avenues  of                        improvement  with  students  based  on  the  result  analyses.  Each  course  coordinator                        shares  the  result  of  the  course  offered  by  him/her  to  the  respective  semester/class                        coordinator,  who  then  forwards  the  same  for  needful  action  through  student                        counselling system.                                                                                                  Page 21 of 40","IQAC - CHARUSAT                       CHARUSAT,  through  student  counselling  system,  aims  to  foster  academic                        excellence,  positive  mental  attitude  and  general  well-being  of  the  students.  The                        student counselling system is a proactive and potential-building activity that identifies                        the factual potential of the students and brings it out, so as to facilitate students to set                        and achieve their academic and personal goals. The system comprises of counsellors,                        primarily the teachers, the students themselves and the professional counselor at the                        University level.                      As soon as a student gets enrolled and begins his/her sessions, he/she is assigned to a                        particular  teacher  counsellor.  It  is  the  teacher  counsellor’s  utmost  responsibility  to                        ensure  that  the  new  incumbent  is  comfortable  in  the  new  environment  and  gets                        acclimatized.  The  illustrative  model  could  be  through  building  a  rapport  with  the                        students by way of different activities, games and informal interactions carried out to                        help  build  strong  teacher-student  relationship.  The  counsellors  keep  continuous                        observation of the academic performance, relation with the peers, behavior patterns                        and  psychological  conditions  of  their  counselees,  so  as  to  be  able  to  track  any                        irregularity at an early stage and suggest corrective actions. For this, the counsellors                        conduct meetings, once in a fortnight, with their counselees.                      The counsellors also keep track of the progression of the students during internship,                        training and project work at other organizations by consulting them.                      Academically  weaker  students  are  encouraged  to  take  up  remedial  classes  and                        practice assignments separately planned by respective course coordinators as a part of                        extending opportunities of improvement in academic performance.                      In addition, individual department/institute also encourages and trains the students to                        participate in the competitive exams like GATE, GPAT, TOFEL, IELTS, NIPER JEE,                        NET, SLAT etc. Efforts are also being made to track the progression of passed out                        students  through  alumni  associations.  For  some  final  year/passed-out  students  who                        obtain  recommendation  letters  for  applying  for  higher  studies  to  other                        universities/institutes  within  or  outside  India,  the  online  recommendation  system                        partially helps in tracking their progression.                      Students’  outstanding  performances  in  other  extra-  and  co-curricular  activities  are                        tracked and recorded by respective activity coordinators across the institutes and are                        acknowledged  during  the  annual  day  celebrations  followed  by  inclusion  in  annual                        reports.                      5.3 (a) Total Number of students                                      UG               PG             Ph.

To identify and understand the existing system and assess the strengths and weaknesses                             of the component institutes.                           2.  To suggest the methods of improvement in weaker segments.                          3.  To identify the limitations in the existing administrative and academic mechanisms and                             explore opportunities to incorporate necessary reforms                           4.  To  encourage  the  optimum  utilization  of  financial,  infrastructural  and  intellectual                             resources.                3.    The Context                      In  a  journey  towards  excellence  in  higher  education,  it  has  been  well  realized  that  quality                      oriented academics should be well supported by strong administrative back-up. To achieve and                      maintain  consistency,  adoption  of  a  well-structured  method  for  continuous  monitoring  and                      evaluation of academic and administrative practices have been increasingly recommended, both                      internally and externally by UGC and other agencies.                 4.    The Practice                      In line with NAAC recommendations, each constituent institute of CHARUSAT is required to                      undertake self-assessment using a proforma designed based on following major criteria, further                      subdivided into various sections to include diverse inputs.                         1.

Innovations and Best Practices                      Each  institute  submits  self-assessment  form  to  University  IQAC,  which  then  facilitates  the                      external  audit  of  all  the  institutes  through  a  peer  team  consisting  of  internal  and  external                      experts. At the end of the audit, the invited experts give inputs to generate an evaluation report.                      Subsequently, respective evaluation reports are circulated to institutional IQAC coordinators,                      who in coordination with institutional heads then facilitate the discussion of the same with the                      other stakeholders.                       Additionally,  every  institutional  IQAC  facilitates  internal  audit  by  creating  awareness  and                      opportunities to perform and improve at various levels.

Evidence of Success                           Overall institutional performances were enhanced and streamlined.                           Institutions  could  realize  the  areas  of  strengths  and  weakness  and  could  explore  the                            scopes of improvement.                 6.    Problems Encountered and Resources Required                           Availability  of  experts  in  relevant  domains  as  per  planned  schedule  was  difficult;                            resulting into prolonging of the duration of overall audit across all the institutes of the                            university.                           Occasional  ambiguous  understanding  of  the  performance  indices  at  institutional  level                            may lead to multiplication or underrating of actual efforts.

Title :- Mentoring faculty members for developing viable research proposals.                     2.  Objective :-                        To  encourage  and  guide  the  faculty  members  to  conceptualize,  prepare  and  present  a                        financially  and  technically/scientifically  viable  proposal  before  being  submitted  to  funding                        bodies.                     3.  Context :-                        While the research funding opportunities in India are increasing, a parallel intensification has                        been  observed  in  the  drive  to  fund  research  proposals  promising  innovation,  quality,                        relevance  and  viability,  across  various  domains  of  science  and  technology.  Owing  to  the                        increasing  competition  and  resource  accessibility,  translating  a  research  project  from                        ‘proposed’  state  to  ‘recommended  for  funding’  state  requires  sincere  efforts  right  from                        identifying thrust research area to conceiving financially and technically relevant yet viable                        objectives to drafting a comprehensive proposal.                         With  this  realization,  CHARUSAT  incepted  a  review  committee  consisting  of                        technical/scientific and financial experts, who primarily reviews the proposals to be submitted                        by all faculty members across the university and facilitates the development of a competitive                        research proposal. Chiefly, this practice was commenced to propel research initiatives taken                        up by faculties at the beginners’ level and help them convert their research idea/plan into a                        successfully funded project at university/state/national/ industrial level.                     4.  The Practice :-                             Faculty  members  from  all  the  constituent  institutes of  the  University  primarily  are                               encouraged  to  draft  a  proposal  and  submit  through  proper  channel  to  the  review                               committee.                              A proposal presentation is scheduled as and when required. The principal investigator                               (PI)  and  co-investigators  (if  any)  are  requested  to  present  their  proposal  to  the                               committee  members.  The  review  committee  may  additionally  include  an  external                               domain expert if required.                             The committee may also take up special review sessions for specific schemes being                               launched from time to time with prior notice, depending on the request received.                              After due interaction with the PI, the proposal is evaluated with respect to technical                               content,  financial  details  and  feasibility  of  execution  within  proposed  duration,                               availability of appropriate infrastructure and expertise.                              Necessary  revisions  are  communicated  to  the  investigators  and  after  successful                               compliance  of  the  same,  the  committee  endorses  the  proposal  as  suitable  for                               submission to relevant funding agency.                     5.  Evidence of Success :-                             Overall quality of the proposals, received for review has improved.                             Proportion  of  research  project  proposals  translating  into  funded  projects  shows  an                               increased trend.
