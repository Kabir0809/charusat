Computerization of administration and library

The CHARUSAT Knowledge Resource Centre (central library) and other Institutional Libraries are using SOUL (Software for University Libraries) library management system to manage day to day activities. SOUL is an integrated multi-user system that supports all inhouse operations of the Library. The SOUL 2.0 consists of modules on acquisition, cataloguing, circulation, serials, article indexing and OPAC. The databases of books available in the institutional and central libraries are being updated day to day with details of recently acquired books. The Resource Centre has installed RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) system to automate library functions. RFID refers to small electronic devices that consist of a small chip and an antenna. The chip typically is capable of carrying up to 2,000 bytes of data. The RFID device serves the same purpose as a bar code or a magnetic strip on the back of a credit card or ATM card; it provides a unique identifier for an object. RFID device must be scanned to retrieve the identifying information. The Resource Centre is also supported by CHARUNIDHI (CHARUSAT D Space), an open access repository for scholarly and/or published digital content. It is an open source repository software package. It is completely customizable to fit users need. It manages and preserves all formats of digital contents such as PDF, Word, JPEG, MPEG, TIFF etc. All functions of libraries are being managed with the help of computer technology, communication technology and storage technology. 4.3 Library Services: Existing

Computer, Internet access, training to teachers and students and any other programme for technology upgradation (Networking, e-Governance etc.) CHARUSAT is committed to provide learning platform to students and staff members. Campus has Wi-Fi connectivity enabling students to access the learning resources either from their institutes, hostels or from the library within the campus. Paperless management through e-governance system is a regular practice at CHARUSAT. Whenever a new module is added to the e-governance system, training sessions have been organised to spread awareness about functionality. Newly admitted students are made aware about e-governance system through a dedicated session in orientation program. Additionally, CHARUSAT had developed two e-systems viz. Centralized Data Base (CDB system). Charusat has adopted D-space (CHARUNIDHI) (Charusat Digital Repository) to manage and retrieve the data generated through various contributions (curricular and extra- and co-curricular) by faculty members and students. Faculty members were imparted training to use these systems through e-governance department/institute coordinators. The various functionalities where e-governance is used include:Customized ERP 13 Modules Paperless/Seamless Governance End-to-End Integration • Student‟s enrollment to degree generation • Employees entry to exit Other process automation and digitization Biometric presence of staff and students E-Notice boards Customized Mobile Apps Smart ID cards Cashless Transactions • Fee Collection • Salary Disbursement • All payments and receipts Inventory management for consumable

Student Support and Progression Contribution of IQAC in enhancing awareness about Student Support Services IQAC has requested all constituent institutes to orient existing and newly admitted students about following students support cells. In addition, display boards have been installed throughout the campus for awareness about these students support cells. Efforts made by the institution for tracking the progression Student‟s progression during study period is determined in parts, based on performance in the courses undertaken and conduct of the student. CHARUSAT, through student counselling system, aims to foster academic excellence, positive mental attitude and general well-being of the students. The student counselling system is a proactive and potential building activity that identifies the true potential of the students and brings it out, so as to facilitate students to achieve their academic and personal goals. The system comprises of counsellors, primarily the teachers, and the students themselves.

5.2

Page 22 of 37

As soon as a student gets enrolled and begins his/her sessions, he/she is assigned to a particular teacher counsellor. It is the teacher counsellor‟s utmost responsibility to ensure that the new incumbent is comfortable in the new environment and gets acclimatized. The illustrative model could be through building a rapport with the students by way of different activities, games and informal interactions carried out to help build strong teacher-student relationship. The counsellors keep continuous observation of the academic performance, relation with the peers, behavior patterns and psychological conditions of their counselees, so as to be able to track any irregularity at an early stage and suggest corrective actions. For this, the counsellors conduct meetings, once in a fortnight, with their counselees. These meets are recorded with signature of the counsellor as well as the counselees. After completion of a Semester and announcement of results of the students, the teacher counsellor segregates their respective counsellees on the basis of academic performance as Potential Learners (CGPA < 5), Progressive Learners (CGPA 5 to 7), and Proficient Learners (CGPA above 7). In order to achieve students‟ optimal development and well-being, a Parent-Teacher‟s meet, with parents of „Potential Learners‟ as well as „Progressive Learners‟, is organized after a month of announcement of results to convey the progress made by the students to their parents. The “Proficient Learners‟ having academic excellence are encouraged and guided for greater participation in Inter-University events and activities, State/ National level competitions/Workshop/Seminars, etc.. Such exposure ultimately contributes to the holistic growth of the students. The counsellors also keep track of the progression of the students during internship, training and project work at other organizations by consulting them. In addition, individual department/institute also encourages and trains the students to participate in the competitive exams like GATE, GPAT, TOFEL, IELTS, NIPER JEE, NET, SLAT etc. Efforts are also being made to track the progression of passed out students through alumni associations. 5.3 (a) Total Number of students
