SOUL is  an integrated multi-user system that supports  all in-               house  operations  of  the  Library.  The  SOUL  2.0  consists  of  modules  on  acquisition,               cataloguing, circulation, serials, article indexing and OPAC. The databases of books available               in the institutional and central libraries are being updated day to day with details of recently               acquired books.                The Resource Centre has installed RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) system to automate               library functions. RFID refers to small electronic devices that consist of a small chip and an               antenna. The chip typically is capable of carrying up to 2,000 bytes of data. The RFID device               serves the same purpose as a bar code or a magnetic strip on the back of a credit card or ATM               card; it provides a unique identifier for an object. RFID device must be scanned to retrieve the               identifying information.                The Resource Centre is  also supported by CHARUNIDHI (CHARUSAT D Space), an open               access repository for scholarly and/or published digital content. It is an open source repository               software package. It is completely customizable to fit users need.

Paperless  management  through  e-governance  system  is  a  regular  practice  at                        CHARUSAT. Whenever a new module is added to the e-governance system, training                        sessions  have  been  organised  to  spread  awareness  about  functionality.  Newly                        admitted  students  are  made  aware  about  e-governance  system  through  a  dedicated                        session in orientation program.

Charusat  has  adopted  D-space  (CHARUNIDHI)  (Charusat  Digital                        Repository) to manage and retrieve the data generated through  various contributions                        (curricular  and  extra-  and  co-curricular)  by  faculty  members  and  students.

CHARUSAT,                        through  student  counselling  system,  aims  to  foster  academic  excellence,  positive                        mental attitude and general well-being of the students. The student counselling system                        is a proactive and potential building activity that identifies the true potential of the                        students and brings it out, so as to facilitate students to achieve their academic and                        personal goals. The system comprises of counsellors, primarily the teachers, and the                        students themselves.                                                                                                  Page 22 of 37","As soon as a student gets enrolled and begins his/her sessions, he/she is assigned to a                        particular  teacher  counsellor.  It  is  the  teacher  counsellor‟s  utmost  responsibility  to                        ensure  that  the  new  incumbent  is  comfortable  in  the  new  environment  and  gets                        acclimatized.  The  illustrative  model  could  be  through  building  a  rapport  with  the                        students by way of different activities, games and informal interactions carried out to                        help build strong teacher-student relationship.                         The counsellors keep continuous observation of the academic performance, relation                        with the peers, behavior patterns and psychological conditions of their counselees, so                        as to be able to track any irregularity at an early stage and suggest corrective actions.                        For this, the counsellors conduct meetings, once in a fortnight, with their counselees.                        These meets are recorded with signature of the counsellor as well as the counselees.                         After  completion  of  a  Semester  and  announcement  of  results  of  the  students,  the                        teacher  counsellor  segregates  their  respective  counsellees  on  the  basis  of  academic                        performance as Potential Learners (CGPA < 5), Progressive Learners (CGPA 5 to 7),                        and  Proficient  Learners  (CGPA  above  7).  In  order  to  achieve  students‟  optimal                        development  and  well-being,  a  Parent-Teacher‟s  meet,  with  parents  of  „Potential                        Learners‟  as  well  as  „Progressive  Learners‟,  is  organized  after  a  month  of                        announcement of results to convey the progress made by the students to their parents.                        The “Proficient Learners‟ having academic excellence are encouraged and guided for                        greater  participation  in  Inter-University  events  and  activities,  State/  National  level                        competitions/Workshop/Seminars,  etc..  Such  exposure  ultimately  contributes  to  the                        holistic growth of the students. The counsellors also keep track of the progression of                        the  students  during  internship,  training  and  project  work  at  other  organizations  by                        consulting them.                         In addition, individual department/institute also encourages and trains the students to                        participate in the competitive exams like GATE, GPAT, TOFEL, IELTS, NIPER JEE,                        NET, SLAT etc. Efforts are also being made to track the progression of passed out                        students through alumni associations.                  5.3     (a) Total Number of students                                     UG               PG             Ph.
