(maximum 500 words)               o Robust mentor-mentee relationship built through student counseling system is an integral part of students’               progression at CHARUSAT. It aims to foster academic excellence, positive mental attitude and general well-              being of the students. The student counseling system is a proactive and potential-building activity that identifies                 the factual potential of the students and brings it out, so as to facilitate students to set and achieve their                 academic and personal goals. The system comprises of counselors, primarily the teachers, the students               themselves and the professional counselor at the University level. o As soon as a student gets enrolled and                begins his/her sessions, he/she is assigned to a particular teacher counselor. It is the teacher counselor’s                  utmost responsibility to ensure that the new incumbent is comfortable in the new environment and gets               acclimatized. The illustrative model could be through building a rapport with the students by way of different                activities, games and informal interactions carried out to help build strong teacher-student relationship. The             counselors keep continuous observation of the academic performance, relation with the peers, behavior patterns              and psychological conditions of their counselees, so as to be able to track any irregularity at an early stage and                suggest corrective actions. For this, the counselors conduct meetings, usually once in a fortnight, with their              counselees. o The counselors also keep track of the progression of the students during internship, training and              project work at other organizations by consulting them. o Academically weaker students are encouraged to take             up remedial classes and practice assignments separately planned by respective course coordinators as a part of              extending opportunities of improvement in academic performance. o In addition, individual department/institute                also encourages and trains the students to participate in the competitive exams like GATE, GPAT, TOFEL,             IELTS, NIPER JEE, NET, SLET etc. Efforts are also being made to track the progression of passed out students               through alumni associations. For some final year/passed-out students who obtain recommendation letters for               applying for higher studies to other universities/institutes within or outside India, the online recommendation             system partially helps in tracking their progression. o Students’ outstanding performances in other extra- and co-               curricular activities are tracked and recorded by respective activity coordinators across the institutes and are              acknowledged during the annual day celebrations followed by inclusion in annual reports. o Counselor teachers              share the academic strengths and weaknesses of the students as well as their observations regarding students’                emotional and psychological status to the parents. In case, a student’s psychological state is realized to be                beyond teachers’ capacity, the student is recommended and facilitated to seek clinical counseling after due                 parents’ consent. A dedicated clinical psychotherapist and counselor has been appointed for the same. o             Towards strengthening the counseling skills of the teachers, HRDC, CHARUSAT organizes various FDPs under                the theme ‘Art of Counseling’. o This counseling platform has been effectively utilized to reach out to all the                   students of CHARUSAT to ensure their and their family’s well-being during the Covid-19 lockdown.

However, at                this juncture while the learning is driven significantly by the overload of              information from the Internet, one requires to learn to thinking creatively to               find solutions to personal and professional problems. Especially considering              the role of the students in shaping the future of the nation, it was realized              that for problems that concern India, tailor-made solutions that apply abroad               may be inappropriate because of significant differences in the socioeconomic                structure, geographical and cultural constraints as well as availability of                resources. Instead, for which the attitude and aptitude to think creatively               needs to be developed in the younger minds. The whole effort is based on the                  occurrence of four inherent abilities in every individual namely Memory,                   Understanding, Thinking and Imagining and that all these four together              contribute towards Creativity, Problem Solving and Innovation. The whole idea              was to transform the memory and understanding-driven learning to imagination-              driven learning and its application. 4) The Practice: • The course content has                been meticulously designed by internationally acclaimed R D expert Dr Anil","Patel and Dr Asha Patel from USA after exhaustive exploration. The content             includes carefully chosen illustrative case studies, TED talks, slideshares and              a range of widely recommended books. • CHARUSAT took this unique initiative in                collaboration with the course patron and developer to consider implementing             this course to teach creative thinking, with two major aspects (i) Training for             the faculty members and (ii) Offering the course to the students. • Initially a              Faculty Development Program was organized to train a group of faculty members                from CHARUSAT with the course strategies and techniques. Their feedback was              considered to improvise upon the course content and transaction guidelines to             make it suitable for the students. Subsequently, the course was introduced as a                mandatory course in the curriculum for fourth semester students of all the             Bachelor level programs offered at CHARUSAT. • The transaction of the course is                  planned across 15 weeks (2h per week) and is strategically divided into                  components like lectures, videos, individual level activities and group                  activities followed by feedback. • Each class includes not more than 30             students to accommodate desired interaction and team work. Group activities are                executed through teams of maximum five students. Students are encouraged to                stimulate thinking on diverse problems and pen down the wildest ideas that               could occur to them on the index cards and post-it notes already provided at               the beginning of the class. At the end of the session the ideas from all the             individuals are displayed for everyone to view and ponder upon. • Uniquely, the              course is not evaluated through the exam. Instead, the evaluation is based on                 attendance, participation, homework assignments and feedback. Independent              involvement of the students in the entire process is emphasized upon. • At the                  end of the course, the students are made to choose a problem, design and              propose the solution as a team work and present their efforts in the form of a               model or posters. • With a mutually accepted goal of promoting this practice               into the existing educational structure, faculty members from other colleges              and universities have been trained over a period of 3 years, so that the same              can be implemented for their students. CHARUSAT serves as a hub to disseminate                 this practice by contributing its faculty members as resource persons and                  facilitate the course transaction under the proposed ‘CHARUSAT National              Training Centre for Creativity’. • A tinkering lab has been established on the                campus to enable the students use their ideas to fabricate solutions to the              problems they have picked up. The special infrastructural facility if required                  can be availed from an array of research labs developed across different                      institutes on the campus. A provision is also made to support any             entrepreneurial idea emerging from young minds motivated through this training.               5) Evidence of Success: • As a unique initiative, the course was approved by             Board of Management and Governing Body, CHARUSAT, under the course structure of                Humanities and Social Sciences • “Anil and Asha Patel Endowment Fund for a                   Course on Creativity” has been created at CHARUSAT with the help of a             philanthropic donation of more than Rs. 2.86 crores so far. • About 100 faculty              members from CHARUSAT have been trained under the mentorship of Dr Anil Patel.                   As per their feedback this training has largely helped changing their                perception from ‘creativity is inbuilt’ to ‘creativity is skill that can be                taught’. • About 4738 of CHARUSAT since past three years have been trained             through this course, with an encouraging feedback • Under the proposed CHARUSAT                National Training Centre on Creativity joining Dr Anil Patel’s ‘Gyaan Daan’             initiative, over 140 faculty members from other educational institutes like CVM                University, VV Nagar P P Savani University, Surat Uka Tarsadia University,                    Bardoli RK University, Rajkot Navrachana University, Vadodara Ganpat                  University, Mehsana and Sankalchand Patel University, Visnagar have been                  trained. 6) Problems Encountered and Resources Required • Persuading the              universities and educational bodies to accept this course as a value addition                to the conventional curriculum implemented BEST PRACTICE-2 1) Title of the             Practice: Introduction of Digital Paperless Examination System – An ecofriendly              exam reform 2) Objectives: • To adopt a major exam reform through technology-","enabled yet environment friendly practice • To optimize the efficiency of the             examination process while ensuring a uniform and consistent approach throughout              exam conduction and evaluation • To facilitate assessment of the attainment of                  course outcomes and strengthening Outcome Based Education (OBE). 3) The                  Context: CHARUSAT believes in increasingly adopting environment friendly               practices in its academics and allied operations. Conduction of examinations                  and ensuring fair yet timely evaluation makes one of the most important                components of progressive academics. Conducting sessional and semester-end              examinations for over 5000 students on campus requires serious consumption of             papers for printing, besides requiring a dedicated storage space for the answer                  books. Conventional mode of exam conduction and evaluation also engages                 dedicated manpower to ensure error free evaluation and results, requiring              intensive investment of man hours. Adopting technological interventions in the                examination process was realized to be the need-of-the-time considering its              ecofriendly nature and benefits in terms of optimal use of human and financial              resources. 4) The Practice: • The digital examination system, an initiative of              IQAC-CHARUSAT, was adopted as a major exam reform after due brainstorming and               approvals from the concerned academic boards of the university. • The system                 was implemented by partnering with M/S Ppyurs India (P) Ltd., (The parent                company, Littlemore Innovation Labs, Singapore), IIT Madras Research Park,                 Chennai, Tamilnadu • Initial implementation involved sharing the standard              operating procedures for authoring the question paper and steps to access and                  answer them followed by subsequent training for all the faculty members,                  students and other concerned staff to understand the system. A team from                    CHARUSAT visited Manipal University, Karnataka to observe the actual              implementation of digital examination and figure out operational difficulties             in order to ensure smoother conduction of the exam. • Mock exams involving both                objective and descriptive questions were conducted to accustom the students             with the device before appearing for the final exam. • The question papers were               uploaded to the cloud 48 h before the scheduled and then were released on to                individual devices at the scheduled time. The inbuilt system of the device              authenticates the identity of the student using biometrics thereby alleviating                 the need of the hall-tickets • The exams were conducted in a conventional                  classroom arrangement but with the pre-tested devices in the presence of                   dedicated technical experts from the partnering company for convenient               troubleshooting as required. As programmed in the devices, the access to the                 exam paper would automatically switch off after defined time period, thus             meeting the supervision needs. • The assessment rights were then distributed to                     the respective internal and external examiners through unique login                  credentials. Remote access to the answer books was also enabled for the              external examiners to facilitate timely assessment. 5) Evidence of Success: •               Acclaimed as first in Gujarat state to have introduced paperless examination               system as a major exam reform • All first year students of CHARUSAT appeared                   for the digital exams conducted using e-tablet devices. The plan is to                gradually take forward the system for students of higher academic years. •                  Assessment of the answer books through remote access made the process of                 assessment by external examiners more convenient, economic and faster. 6)                   Problems Encountered and Resources Required • Ensuring robust internet                connectivity throughout • Sufficient hardware to meet the student numbers •                                            Technologically skilled set of                Upload details of two best practices successfully implemented by the institution as per NAAC format in your                                                institution website, provide the link              7.3 – Institutional Distinctiveness            7.3.1 – Provide the details of the performance of the institution in one area distinctive to its vision, priority and           thrust in not more than 500 words","Towards its vision to grow into an organization with excellence in teaching,                  research and social contribution, CHARUSAT has increasingly adopted the              approach of encouraging research-driven teaching and learning. The university                functions with a prime focus on devising encouraging policies and smoother                 administrative processes, establishment and upgrade of infrastructure and             emphasis on recruiting/promoting the existing human resource (including faculty               members, doctoral and post-doctoral students) to undertake diverse inter and               multidisciplinary research activities with a complete autonomy to choose the              research domain. A unique initiative towards propelling the research endeavors              has been the establishment of Dr K C Patel Research and Development Center to                 foster focused research in diverse multidisciplinary areas. Subsequently,             CHARUSAT Space Research and Technology Center (CSRTC), Shri Pramukhswami Center              of Excellence in Renewable Energy and International Center for Cosmology (ICC)                were also established with an aim of engaging in research across identified              thrust areas of national relevance. These research centers currently undertake              diverse collaborative projects funded through government agencies, industries               and philanthropy as well as engage in teaching. Undergraduate, postgraduate,                   doctoral students, post-doctoral fellows and faculties from different                institutes with relevant expertise, get an opportunity to become a part of              these projects. In turn, this experience gets translated into higher level of              teaching-learning practices. Some of the student project outcomes have yielded                  research publications. The research experiences gained, further help the                students in seeking better opportunities in placement and higher studies. •             KRADLE has successfully executed 16 projects worth >500 lacs INR.
