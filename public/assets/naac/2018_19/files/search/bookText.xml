           2.3.2 – Students mentoring system available in the institution? Give details. (maximum 500 words)

              o Robust mentormentee relationship built through student counselling system is an integral part of students’
              progression at CHARUSAT. It aims to foster academic excellence, positive mental attitude and general well
             being of the students. The student counselling system is a proactive and potential building activity that identifies
                the factual potential of the students and brings it out, so as to facilitate students to set and achieve their
                academic and personal goals. The system comprises of counsellors, primarily the teachers, the students
              themselves and the professional counselor at the University level. o As soon as a student gets enrolled and
               begins his/her sessions, he/she is assigned to a particular teacher counsellor. It is the teacher counsellor’s
                 utmost responsibility to ensure that the new incumbent is comfortable in the new environment and gets
              acclimatized. The illustrative model could be through building a rapport with the students by way of different
               activities, games and informal interactions carried out to help build strong teacher student relationship. The
            counsellors keep continuous observation of the academic performance, relation with the peers, behavior patterns
             and psychological conditions of their counselees, so as to be able to track any irregularity at an early stage and
               suggest corrective actions. For this, the counsellors conduct meetings, usually once in a fortnight, with their
             counselees. o The counsellors also keep track of the progression of the students during internship, training and
             project work at other organizations by consulting them. o Academically weaker students are encouraged to take
            up remedial classes and practice assignments separately planned by respective course coordinators as a part of
             extending opportunities of improvement in academic performance. o In addition, individual department/institute
               also encourages and trains the students to participate in the competitive exams like GATE, GPAT, TOFEL,
            IELTS, NIPER JEE, NET, SLET etc. Efforts are also being made to track the progression of passed out students
              through alumni associations. For some final year/passed out students who obtain recommendation letters for
              applying for higher studies to other universities/institutes within or outside India, the online recommendation
             system partially helps in tracking their progression. o Students’ outstanding performances in other extra and co
              curricular activities are tracked and recorded by respective activity coordinators across the institutes and are
            acknowledged during the annual day celebrations followed by inclusion in annual reports. o Counsellor teachers
             share the academic strengths and weaknesses of the students as well as their observations regarding students’
               emotional and psychological status to the parents. In case, a student’s psychological state is realized to be
               beyond teachers’ capacity, the student is recommended and facilitated to seek clinical counseling after due
               parents’ consent. A dedicated clinical psychotherapist and counsellor has been appointed for the same. o
            Towards strengthening the counseling skills of the teachers, HRDC, CHARUSAT organizes various FDPs under
                                                 the theme ‘Art of Counselling’.

              BEST PRACTICE1 1) Title of the Practice: Sustained efforts towards improving]]></page><page Index="39"><![CDATA[the quality of life within the rural vicinity. 2) Objectives: • To enhance the
             livelihood of the local rural community. • To improve the access of the rural
            community to various resources and infrastructure. • To contribute its share as
                 a responsible organization towards national developmental goals. 3) The
                 Context: Thriving for progressive sustenance with quality and integrity,
              CHARUSAT realizes its responsibility towards serving the society. Having its
                 expanse in the rural land which itself is a generous contribution of the
              village and its inhabitants CHARUSAT has been actively involved in endeavors
             focused upon improving the rural development at various levels, which not only
             align with its own mission but are also some of the leading national concerns.
             4) The Practice: (i) Dissemination of knowledge Faculty members and student of
                     CHARUSAT have volunteered to impart free primary education to the
            underprivileged children in the vicinity. These activities are either organized
             through NSS or students’ council as oncampus evening sessions. Besides, group
             of students have extended their outreach for the same in the nearby villages.
                  The drive is to help these children realize and fulfill their right to
                 education, as far as possible. (ii) Uplifting socioeconomic state of the
            surrounding dwellers To cater to the increasing needs of the students oncampus,
              various small scale businesses have been set up, which in turn have added to
            their source of income, while being resourceful for the local citizens as well.
             Besides, the locals have been largely employed as oncampus support staff, thus
                   generating employment for the rural community. (iii) Infrastructural
                  development Owing to the growing students’ strength on campus and the
                developing surroundings, CHARUSAT has managed to enhance bus connectivity
               within the rural areas through the support of Gujarat State Road Transport
             Corporation (GSRTC). University has constructed and maintains a bus stand for
             convenient facilitation of the transport. Mobile network towers are set up to
               enhance internet connectivity. (iv) Healthcare and hygiene Through faculty
            members and students, CHARUSAT reaches out to wide rural community to sensitize
                them regarding the importance of maintaining personal and public hygiene.
            Several prominent activities include camps for pre and postnatal maternal care,
            subsidized medical facilities, and distribution of free sanitary napkins across
              nearby villages. Awareness camps are organized to help them understand their
             role and the benefits of joining the national campaigns of Swachha Bharat and
             Swasth Bharat as well as statelevel antiaddiction drives. (v) Other practices
             include • Empowering the progression of students from rural background through
             quality student support system, exposure to equal opportunities on campus and
               financial support for higher studies through philanthropy. • Rural farming
               community is involved in undertaking several agribased research projects on
                 voluntary basis thereby sensitizing them towards their potential role in
               supporting development of science and technology. 5) Evidence of Success: •

              CHARUSAT envisages to grow into an organization with excellence in teaching,
                research and social contribution. Towards these goals, the University has
             increasingly adopted the approach of encouraging research driven teaching and
            learning. To empower this, University has established Dr K C Patel Research and
               Development Center to foster focused research in diverse multidisciplinary
               areas. Subsequently, CHARUSAT Space Research and Technology Center (CSRTC),
              Shri Pramukhswami Center of Excellence in Renewable Energy and International
               Center for Cosmology (ICC) were also established with an aim of engaging in
             research across identified thrust areas of national relevance. These research
                  centers currently undertake diverse projects funded through government
              agencies, industries and philanthropy. Undergraduate, postgraduate, doctoral
               students, postdoctoral fellows and faculties from different institutes with
             relevant expertise, get an opportunity to become a part of these projects. In
              turn, this experience gets translated into higher level of teaching learning
             practices. The project investigation experiences gained by the students helps
             them further in seeking better opportunities in placement and higher studies.
              Besides, independent research labs for faculties are developed under various
                 government funded projects are also utilized to train undergraduate and
              postgraduate students through dissertation and projects. This helps students
             gain a hands on experience with advanced techniques as well as develop better
                  scientific know how. Following initiatives are taken by University to
                 facilitate research: o CHARUSAT Research grant (seed money) for faculty
            members. o International travel support to faculty members for participating in
                      international events. o Activities under Endowment Chair in each
